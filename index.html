<!doctype html>

<!-- 
    
    The above must be the first line in an html web page. 
    This declaration helps browsers display the page correctly.

    Below, we open our html tag. See the closing tag all the way at the bottom? 
    Closing tags are like the opening tag but start with a backslash.

    The html element has a 'lang' attribute that specifies the language of the page content. 
    It's used by search engines and browsers. 

    HTML is organized like a family tree except everyone has only one parent. 
    (Except for the root element (html), which has no parent.)

    The html element has two child elements: 
    
    - head (for meta information) and 
    - body (for page content)

    You can collapse sections in VS Code 
    by mousing over a line number and clicking the arrow.  

    Try to collapse the head section after reading it, to focus on the body.
    Then expand the head again to see the whole structure.

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <!--

    The 'head' section is used for information about the webpage. 
    Almost all pages will start with the first two tags below.

    The first sets the character encoding (not all pages are written in English)
    and the second sets the viewport so the page looks good on all size devices.

    The 'title' tag is used to set the title of the page in the browser tab.

    At the end of the head section, we link to style sheets.
    First, we link to Bootstrap, a CSS framework that makes it easy to style our page.
    Then, we link to our own custom CSS file for additional styling.

<body>
    <!-- 

    The 'body' section is for content that appears on the webpage. 

    We often start with a navbar or nav tags. 
    'nav' is a semantic HTML element that typically contains navigation links 
    'header' is a semantic HTML element that typically contains the heading of the page or section 
    'section', 'aside', and 'article' are semantic HTML elements that help describe the structure of the content

    Navigation links appear as clickable text that will take you to the specified URLs when clicked 
    Your apps can link to public pages for easy reference, or local pages for more complex apps.
   
    Several elements have 'class' attributes. 
    Classes are used to group elements for CSS styling or JavaScript logic.
    For instance, elements with the class 'sidebar' will all receive the 
    same styles defined for .sidebar in our CSS file.
    
    The 'input' elements are used to gather user input 
    Each input element has an 'id' attribute to identify that specific element in our JavaScript code.

    At the end of the body section, we use 'script' tags to link to JavaScript files.
    In this file, we first link to Bootstrap's JavaScript file.
    Then we link to our own custom logic in our own main.js JavaScript file.
